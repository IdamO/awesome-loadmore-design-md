# Design System Inspiration of Anna Ley

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere

Anna Ley reads as experimental mobile-first composition. The live capture resolves to a light-leaning system built around #fefefd, #a4a79e, and accent notes from #cdcbb2. Very cute and unusual navigation which lets you spin a wheel to browse the artist's works.

Desktop and mobile stay aligned but not identical: the desktop capture emphasizes a looser scroll narrative, while mobile compresses the same language into tighter interaction zones. The site's type system centers a bespoke stack, which becomes the fastest way to reproduce the feel.

Key Characteristics:
- Primary tone: bright surfaces with editorial contrast
- Core palette: #fefefd, #a4a79e, #cdcbb2, #656462
- Typography stack: system fallback
- Desktop posture: flowing document rhythm
- Mobile posture: single-column immersive scroll

## 2. World Systems & Archetype

### World Systems
- Primary: Fan Shrine - tags include portfolio; archetype affinity: portfolio artifact
- Secondary: Luxury Archive - archetype affinity: portfolio artifact

### Interaction Archetype
- Archetype: Portfolio Artifact (85% confidence)
- Why: tags include portfolio; description mentions artist
- Core verbs: read, browse, contact
- Inputs: scroll, tap, hover



## 3. Color Palette & Roles

- Color 1: #fefefd - canvas / dominant background
- Color 2: #a4a79e - primary text or opposing surface
- Color 3: #cdcbb2 - accent / interactive signal
- Color 4: #656462 - supporting surface or hover state
- Color 5: #e75e05 - supporting surface or hover state
- Color 6: #252423 - supporting surface or hover state
- Color 7: #9d9e61 - supporting surface or hover state
- Color 8: #cf9d9e - supporting surface or hover state

## 4. Typography Rules

### Font Families
- Primary: system UI

### Hierarchy Snapshot
- Heading sample: n/a / weight n/a / letter-spacing normal
- Body sample: 36px / weight 400 / line-height 172.8px
- Button sample: n/a / weight n/a

## 5. Layout Principles

- Use a free-flowing vertical canvas on desktop.
- Keep mobile single-column and immersive rather than dashboard-like.
- Let the main background color (#fefefd) carry the atmosphere instead of layering multiple competing surfaces.
- Preserve asymmetry when present - the archive tags (portfolio, animation) imply the system is intentionally non-generic.
- Buttons tend toward transparent backgrounds with inherit text, and links inherit rgb(0, 0, 0) as the interaction signal.

## 6. Interaction Mechanics

- Primary model: portfolio_artifact
- Navigation structure: linear / wayfinding ambient / friction low
- Navigation model: The author voice or project sequence leads; navigation stays secondary and quiet.
- State model: Arrival -> authored sequence of text, image, or projects -> contact or archive state.
- Must-keep mechanic: Asymmetrical document flow, authored modules, and selective reveals make the portfolio itself feel like a designed object.

## 7. Motion System

- Density: low
- Cadence: event-driven
- Triggers: scroll, pointer
- Transition types: fade, crop-shift
- Physics level: none
- Motion recipe:
  - Use restrained reveals and occasional viewpoint shifts.
  - Let typography and image sequencing do more work than animation.
  - Use one irrational but coherent move to keep the page from feeling templated.

## 8. Spatial Model

- Space type: flat
- Camera behavior: fixed
- Depth cues: scale
- HUD layering: none
- Render tier: dom
- Primary depth cue in capture: flat surfaces / contrast-only separation

## 9. Participation & State

- Participation mode: browse
- Persistence: none
- Inputs to preserve: scroll, tap, hover
- Reset/save posture: Default to resettable, lightweight state changes.

## 10. Sound & Sensor Behavior

- Audio role: none
- Audio triggers: none
- Controls: none
- Sync: none
- Required APIs or platform hooks: none

## 11. Implementation Checklist

- Complexity: low
- Required APIs: none
- Must-have mechanics:
  - Keep one strong authorial decision intact across breakpoints.
  - Use type, pacing, and framing as the identity before relying on motion.
  - If the site feels like a normal portfolio shell, push one layer further.
- Nice-to-have embellishments:
  - tags include portfolio
  - description mentions artist
- Mobile fallback: Keep the asymmetry in rhythm and type, but simplify the layout into a single authored column with strong anchors.
- Fallback path: single-column, reduced-motion
- Manual validation:
  - The author voice is visible within three seconds.
  - Projects or writing feel sequenced, not dumped into a grid.
  - Mobile preserves the same voice without literal layout copying.

## 12. Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use the primary extracted font consistently for headlines and interface labels.
- Keep the palette anchored to #fefefd, #a4a79e, and #cdcbb2.
- Preserve the experimental posture signaled by the archive tags: portfolio, animation.
- Build separate desktop and mobile compositions instead of pretending one layout can fake both.
- Use the inferred mechanics schema as the implementation baseline before adding ornament.

### Don't
- Don't genericize the interface into a default SaaS landing page.
- Don't introduce rounded, pastel, or glassmorphism defaults unless the captured site already does.
- Don't replace the extracted font stack with Inter/Roboto/system as the main voice unless no custom stack loaded.
- Don't ignore the mobile fallback just because the desktop interaction is more fun.
- Don't copy screenshots literally when the repo only has archival capture evidence.

## 13. Responsive Behavior

- Desktop capture uses screenshots/desktop.jpg as the visual baseline.
- Mobile capture uses screenshots/mobile.jpg as the mobile baseline.
- Keep touch targets oversized on mobile and allow the background system to dominate the viewport.
- Implement mobile as: Keep the asymmetry in rhythm and type, but simplify the layout into a single authored column with strong anchors..
- If the live site failed to capture, fall back to the archival poster on the loadmo.re post page before inventing missing behavior.

## 14. Agent Prompt Guide

Use this when asking an AI coding agent to recreate the feel:

> Build this as a Fan Shrine page with a secondary cue from Luxury Archive using the Portfolio Artifact interaction model. Keep the extracted primary font as the voice anchor, preserve the palette around #fefefd, #a4a79e, #cdcbb2, drive the page through scroll, tap, hover, and implement the mobile fallback as: Keep the asymmetry in rhythm and type, but simplify the layout into a single authored column with strong anchors.
